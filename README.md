# Discord Bot
## Overview 
I was playing around with code and decided to implement a discord bot which can reply certain discord messages that you send with a prefix. It can also join and leave voice channels.

## Usage
### Run the file

**You need to have a discord developer token!!**
*if you do not have it head over to* [Discord Developer Website](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro)

```shell
# run main.py file
python main.py
```

### Stop the file
Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> (Keyboard Interrupt) in the terminal to stop the discord bot from running.
